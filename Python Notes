1.Python Intro
Python is a high level general purpose programming language

High Level - easy to understand and easy to implement

General Purpose -
1.App Development
2.Web Development
3.Game Development
4. AI
5. Automation Testing
6. Ethical Hacking
7. Etc…

History:
Python - 1991 - Guido Van Rossum
He named it python because he was highly inspired
By the circus show “Monty’s Python Flying Circus”

Features of Python?
1.High Level - easy to learn and easy to implement
2.General Purpose
3.Dynamically Typed Programming
	type - dynamic
   C: 
       Int x =78; statically typed

    Py:  
       X= 12
4.Python has its own collection of libraries
5.Open Source
6.Interpreted Programming
Interpreter - it executes the program in Line by Line Manner
Compiler - it executes the whole program at once.
7.Multiparadigm
Procedural (step wise), functional & Object Oriented


2.variables  - 
X = 15
X is variable
15 is constant

Identifiers - Identifiers are the user defined names which are used to define variable, class, function etc
1.Identifier’s name cannot be started with special character(except _) or numerical value
2.Also identifiers name must not contain any space or special character except _.

KEYWORDS - are the predefined words used for special functionalities.



3.Data Types
Number - int , float , complex
Boolean
None
String

Maths module

4.Data Collection - List,Tuple,Dictionary
Conditional Statements
Loops




Operators
1.  Arithmetical +,-,/,*,%,//-floor div,**-power
2. Assignment Operator  - =,+=,/=,*=,//=,&=,!=,etc
3. Logical Operator  and or not
4. Bitwise - logical , shifting
5. Relational Operator >,<,>=,<=,!=,==
6. Ternary Operator  (condition)?if true:if false
7. Membership Operator - in , not in
8. Identity Operator is , is not

Blocks in Python? - Indentation
X =15
If X%2==0:
    print(“even”)
else:
	print(“Odd”)

Conditional Statements
If 
If else
Ladder if else
Nested else
For else

x = int(input("Enter No1:"))
for i in range(2,x):
    if x%i==0:
        print("Not Prime")
        break
else:
    print("Prime")
